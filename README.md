## Important: Local CLI Only

This skill is designed for local CLI agents (Claude Code / Codex), not sandboxed web chat environments.

It requires:
- Local browser automation
- Local auth persistence
- Local filesystem state under `data/`

---

## The Problem

When your product docs, research notes, and references live in Youmind boards, coding workflows get fragmented:

- You jump between terminal and browser repeatedly
- You lose context while copy-pasting questions and answers
- Board metadata is inconsistent, so retrieval quality drops
- Login/setup friction interrupts research flow

## The Solution

This skill lets your coding agent ask Youmind directly:

```text
Your task -> Agent asks Youmind board chat -> Youmind answers -> Agent continues implementation
```

No manual copy-paste loop.

---

## Why Youmind, Not Manual Copy-Paste?

| Approach | Context Switching | Setup | Reliability | Velocity |
|----------|-------------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Browser copy-paste | High | Instant | Human-error prone | Slow |
| Ad-hoc local file search | Medium | Low | Misses board-level context | Medium |
| Youmind Skill | Low | Minutes | Consistent board routing + saved auth | High |

### What this skill adds on top of plain Youmind chat

1. Agent-native workflow in terminal
2. Persistent authentication across runs
3. Reusable board library with active-board selection
4. Smart Add auto metadata discovery and naming
5. Follow-up reminder flow to reduce incomplete answers

---

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Create skills directory (if needed)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

# 2. Clone repository
cd ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/p697/youmind-skill.git

# 3. Enter skill directory
cd youmind-skill
```

On first real use, the skill auto-creates `.venv`, installs dependencies, and installs Chrome runtime for Patchright.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Check available skills

Say in Claude Code/Codex:

```text
What skills do I have?
```

### 2. Authenticate once

```text
Set up Youmind authentication
```

A browser opens, you complete login, and auth state is stored locally.

### 3. Add your board

Option A: Smart Add (recommended)

```text
Smart add this board: https://youmind.com/boards/...
```

Option B: Manual add

```text
Add this Youmind board to my library: https://youmind.com/boards/...
```

### 4. Start querying

```text
Ask my Youmind board: summarize the key technical decisions
```

---

## Smart Add (NotebookLM-Style Auto Naming)

Smart Add is the Youmind mapping of NotebookLM skill's one-click auto onboarding.

What it does:
1. Queries the board automatically
2. Extracts structured metadata (`name`, `description`, `topics`)
3. Saves the board to local library
4. Activates it by default

Discovery modes:
- Two-pass (default): summary then structured JSON extraction
- Single-pass: one structured extraction query

If extraction quality is poor, the workflow falls back to summary-based metadata generation.

---

## How It Works

This is a local skill folder with instructions + Python automation scripts.

```text
SKILL.md
scripts/
  run.py
  auth_manager.py
  board_manager.py
  ask_question.py
  browser_utils.py
  browser_session.py
  cleanup_manager.py
  setup_environment.py
references/
  api_reference.md
  usage_patterns.md
  troubleshooting.md
data/ (generated locally)
```

Runtime model:
1. Agent detects Youmind intent
2. Agent runs the matching script via `scripts/run.py`
3. Browser automation opens Youmind and submits query
4. Answer is returned to the agent
5. Agent decides whether follow-up questions are needed

---

## Core Features

### Source-constrained board querying
Queries are grounded in the selected Youmind board context.

### Board library management
Add/list/search/activate/remove boards with local metadata persistence.

### Persistent authentication
One-time login with reusable local browser state.

### Smart Add auto onboarding
Board metadata discovery with automatic naming and topic generation.

### Local isolation
Dependencies and state stay inside the skill folder.

## Common Prompts

| What you say | What happens |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Set up Youmind authentication" | Opens browser login and saves auth state |
| "Smart add this board: [link]" | Auto-discovers metadata and saves board |
| "Show my Youmind boards" | Lists saved board library |
| "Use this board: [name/id]" | Sets active board |
| "Ask my Youmind board about [topic]" | Queries board chat and returns answer |
| "Clean Youmind local state" | Clears generated local runtime data |

---

## Limitations

- Browser automation (not an official Youmind API)
- UI selector drift may occur when Youmind updates frontend
- Stateless ask model (each run is an independent query)
- Smart Add quality depends on board chat response quality

---

## Troubleshooting

Try these prompts first:

```text
Re-authenticate Youmind
Show browser and retry the same question
List my board library
```

## Security Notes

- `data/` contains auth/browser state and must not be committed
- Use a dedicated automation account if your organization requires strict separation
